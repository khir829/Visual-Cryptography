# Visual-Cryptography
A visual cryptography program using MATLAB  
This was a 2021 project assignment at the University of Auckland set by Pete Bier (https://profiles.auckland.ac.nz/p-bier)  
  
This project requirec me to write code that will encrypt and decrypt messages using a technique
known as visual cryptography.  
  
Cryptographic algorithms are extremely important and allow messages to be sent securely from one
party to another, without having to worry about anyone else being able to read the message if it is
intercepted. Many web-based platforms rely on cryptography to send important messages securely.
For example, when you want to pay for something online, the online store needs to be sent a
message telling them your credit card number, but you donâ€™t want anyone else being able to
intercept that message (and steal your credit card details) so the message needs to be encrypted.
Cryptographic algorithms work by allowing you to encrypt a message, send it securely and then
decrypt it to obtain the original message.  
  
Visual cryptography is highly secure, as it is impossible to decrypt a cipher image, unless you have
the correct key image.

This code can take an image and make a key and cipher image out of it.  
The only limitation is that the image that is decrypted using the key and cipher images will be a binary black and white image.  
It is best if the image you may want to encrypt is originally black and white.
